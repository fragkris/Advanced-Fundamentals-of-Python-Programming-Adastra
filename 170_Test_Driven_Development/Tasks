In this exercise you will create a set of test cases to test a bank Account class.
Each new Account must have an account number, a date of opening, an interest rate,
and an opening balance. It must support methods to deposit and withdraw money and
to transfer money between accounts. Do not implement the Account class
(a dummy implementation is enough - all methods should just "pass") and hence all tests shall fail.

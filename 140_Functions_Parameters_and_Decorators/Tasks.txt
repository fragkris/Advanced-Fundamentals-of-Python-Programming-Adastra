PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 

- Write a function which takes any number of parameters and returns their average.
            (ex1_kris.py)

- Write a function to calculate Lucas numbers using the na√Øve recursion.
Lucas numbers are very similar to Fibonacci numbers and are defined by L(0)=2, L(1)=1 and L(n)=L(n-1)+L(n-2)
            (ex2_kris.py)

- Use a timing decorator to log how long each call.
How long does it take to calculate L(35)? What about L(100)?
            (ex2_kris.py) (row 11 to 24)

- Now add a memoize decorator. Can you calculate L(100) now?
            (ex2_kris.py) (row 28 - need to be uncommented)

- Write a function which does prime factorization of a number, e.g. 20633239 = 11*29*71*911.
Calculate the prime factorization of L(60) and L(61).

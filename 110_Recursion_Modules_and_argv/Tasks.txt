Modify the script to work with long words. We require that it prints approx.
20 randomly chosen permutations of the input word. 
It is important that the printed permutations are chosen at random, 
but it is not important to print exactly 20 each time. 
(Hint: import math, random. You are allowed to use global variables!)

Now let’s read from standard input and count words and introduce the dictionary type - dict. 
A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. 
In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, 
and they have keys and values. More on this in chapter 115.

The standard input stream (sys.stdin) is iterable, 
line by line, so it can be used in a for statement. 
The findall function from the re module produces the list of tokens on the line matching a pattern. 
We accumulate counts for each word in a dictionary. 
The dictionary lookup method get accepts a “default” value to return in case of a missing key (here 0), 
which makes counting quite elegant. 
You may also notice that Python makes iterating the pairs of a dictionary in sorted order quite easy. 

 

Read about pylint and configure it so that it becomes an integral part of your development routine. 
Alternative linters are also available and it is largely a matter of choice (or corporate standards) which one you use, 
but for now let's stick with pylint.

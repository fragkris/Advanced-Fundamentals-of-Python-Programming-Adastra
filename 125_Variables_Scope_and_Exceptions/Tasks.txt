PROGRAMMING EXERSIZE



There is a file which contains temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, one string per line. The strings are expected to look like this: 10F or -15C.



Write a Python program which asks:

the user for an input value for the file location

reads the file line by line

converts each temperature to Fahrenheit if it is in Celsius

writes the converted values in a new file



The input and output values should be floating-point numbers.



What could make this program crash? What would we need to do to handle this situation more gracefully?

PROGRAMMING EXERCISE
 

1. Use the finnhub.io websockets API to retrieve in real-time data the bitcoin price from the Binance exchange.
You'll need to following symbol: 
BINANCE:BTCUSDT. The payload is json, so use the json module in Python to transform the message to dict. 

Your class should have the option to output in the console all relevant trades in the following format:
"2020-03-05 09:08:41 price:8921.06 volume:0.051236"

2. Implement a data structure which calculates time averages.
For each one minute period (e.g. 10:00-10:01, 10:01-10:02, etc.) 
calculate the volume-weighted average price of trades made during this minute. 
Keep in mind that there may be late-arriving data, 
and the messages you receive are not guaranteed to be ordered.
